JOY merges simple construction with playful aesthetics, bringing laid-back style to the age of standards. JOY was founded in 2021 as an open space for Stockholm based designer Fredrik Paulsen. The idea is simple: slick, forward looking style meets small scale production at a reasonable price. All JOY objects are designed and manufactured in Sweden. And hey: everything packs flat.Contemporary design is boring. JOY isn’t. JOY is fun. JOY is groovy. JOY is here."
